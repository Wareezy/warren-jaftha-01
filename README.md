# Linear Regression Model Using Rust's Burn Library

## Project Description

This project demonstrates the development of a simple AI model for linear regression using the Rust programming language and the Burn library (version 0.16). The objective is to predict the output of the function `y = 2x + 1` by training the model on synthetic data.

## Features

- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Generates sample data based on `y = 2x + 1`.
- **Model Training**: Implements a simple linear regression model using Burn.
- **Evaluation**: Compares model predictions with expected values.
- **Rust-Based Implementation**: Leverages the Rust ecosystem for efficient computation.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

#### Setup Rust and Rust Rover IDE

1. **Install Rust**:
    - Download and install Rust from [Rust's official site](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
    - Verify the installation by running the following command in your terminal:
      ```sh
      rustc --version
      ```

2. **Install Rust Rover IDE**:
    - Download Rust Rover from [JetBrains Rust Rover](https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/).
    - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

- **Burn Library**: This project uses the Burn library version 0.16.0. Dependencies are specified in the `Cargo.toml` file.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    - Open your terminal or command prompt.
    - Execute the following command:
      ```sh
      git clone https://github.com/Wareezy/warren-jaftha-01.git
      ```
    - Navigate into the project directory:
      ```sh
      cd warren-jaftha-01
      ```

2. **Build the Project**:
    - Compile the project using Cargo:
      ```sh
      cargo build
      ```

3. **Run the Application**:
    - Execute the project with:
      ```sh
      cargo run
      ```
    - The program will generate synthetic data, train the linear regression model, and output the model's parameters along with predictions.

## Approach to the Problem

### Data Generation

To train the model, synthetic data was generated based on the linear function `y = 2x + 1`. This involved creating input values (`x`) and computing the corresponding outputs (`y`).

### Model Implementation

The linear regression model was implemented using the Burn library. The process included:

- **Defining the Model**: Creating a struct representing the linear regression model with necessary parameters.
- **Training**: Implementing a training loop to adjust the model's parameters to fit the synthetic data.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance by comparing its predictions to the actual data.

### Challenges Faced

- One of the primary challenges was ensuring compatibility between different versions of the Burn library. The project specifically uses version 0.16.0, and care was taken to align the code with this version's API.
- Another Challenge that I faced in particular when dealing with this particular assignment was the short time frame to solve the problem we only got 1 week which is in my opinion not enough time to learn a foreign language and to be thrown in the deep end to be solving problems.
- Another problem that I faced was particularly was with the imports. Don't know why but I assume it's because of the dependencies once again that when using the proper imports it would also give me an error then when trying to debug it will give errors regarding "Dependency Versions". 

## Resources Utilized

- **Burn Library Documentation**: Provided guidance on implementing the model and understanding the library's features.
- **Rust Programming Language Documentation**: Assisted in understanding Rust-specific constructs and best practices.
- **Online Tutorials and Articles**: Various online resources offered insights into machine learning concepts and their implementation in Rust.
- **AI Tools (ChatGPT, Phind, etc.)**: These AI tools assisted with problem-solving and understanding errors in the code, which was helpful for debugging purposes.
- **YouTube Videos**: As this was my first time working with Rust and Rust Rover IDE, I relied heavily on tutorial videos to understand the language and complete the assignment.

### Additional Resources

- **Rust Documentation**: [https://doc.rust-lang.org/](https://doc.rust-lang.org/)
- **Burn Library Documentation**: [https://docs.rs/burn/0.16.0/burn/](https://docs.rs/burn/0.16.0/burn/)
- **GitHub Guide**: [https://docs.github.com/en/get-started](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started)
- **Rust Rover Documentation**: [https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rust/](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rust/)
- **LaTeX Documentation**: [https://www.latex-project.org/help/](https://www.latex-project.org/help/)

## Results and Evaluation

The model successfully learned the relationship `y = 2x + 1` from the synthetic data. The trained model's parameters closely approximated the expected values:

- **Slope (m)**: Approximately 2
- **Intercept (c)**: Approximately 1

Predictions made by the model on new data points were consistent with the expected outcomes, indicating effective learning and generalization.

## Reflection on Learning

### Assistance Received

Throughout the project, I received significant help from AI tools, online documentation, and video tutorials. Given that this was my first time working with Rust and Rust Rover IDE, I encountered difficulties in understanding the assignment and implementing the required functionality. The assistance from AI tools like ChatGPT and Phind was particularly useful for troubleshooting errors and debugging my code efficiently.

Additionally, I extensively used the official documentation for Rust and the Burn library, as well as community forums and GitHub guides. YouTube tutorials played a crucial role in helping me grasp key concepts and workflow practices in Rust development.

Throughout the project, significant assistance was obtained from:

- **Burn Library Documentation**: Essential for understanding the library's functionalities and effectively implementing the model.
- **Rust Community Forums**: Helpful in resolving programming challenges and gaining insights into best practices.

### Learning Outcomes

- **Understanding of Linear Regression**: Gained a deeper comprehension of linear regression and its implementation.
- **Proficiency with Burn Library**: Developed skills in utilizing the Burn library for machine learning tasks in Rust.
- **Rust Programming Skills**: Enhanced overall proficiency in Rust, particularly in the context of machine learning applications.

### Challenges in Solving the Problem

- I failed to solve the problem. The main reason for this was the strict limitations on dependencies that we were allowed to use. This restriction significantly reduced flexibility and creativity in developing solutions, ultimately leading to a lack of effective solutions being produced.
- **WHAT I LEARNED FROM THIS EXPERIENCE** : I realized that being confined to strict rules—such as not changing dependencies—can make it challenging to develop creative solutions. Innovation thrives when you have the freedom to explore different dependencies and resources to solve a problem effectively.

## Conclusion

This project provided valuable experience in developing a machine learning model using Rust and the Burn library. It offered insights into the challenges and considerations of implementing linear regression and highlighted the importance of thorough testing and validation. The skills and knowledge acquired through this project lay a strong foundation for future endeavors in machine learning with Rust.
